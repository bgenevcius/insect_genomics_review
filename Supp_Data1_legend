Supplementary data 1. Resulting database from our systematic search on the genetic bases of morphological adaptation and plasticity in insects. This search was conducted on May 23, 2024. We used both the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Raw search was manually filtered to match our criteria (see manuscript for details): studies should necessarily include three features - 1) variation in a morphological trait, 2) an underlying molecular mechanism, and 3) an associated environmental condition. Note that studies that studied more than one trait, genetic mechanism or environmental condition, may have multiple entries.
